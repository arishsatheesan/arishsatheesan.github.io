<p style="font-size:100%;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">

I currently work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at iNETS (Institute for Networked Systems), RWTH Aachen University, Germany. My research centers upon developing experimental platforms for 6G MAC prototyping on reconfigurable hardware.
</p>
<p style="font-size:100%;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">
I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at COSIC (ES&S Subgroup), KU Leuven, Belgium, under the supervision of Prof. Nele Mentens. During my Ph.D., I worked on the field of Network Security, specifically in the Acceleration of Large Flow Detection algorithms using configurable hardware (FPGA), in collaboration with the Network Security Group, ETH Zurich, on the joint research project ESCALATE. 
</p>
<p style="font-size:100%;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">
I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Cochin University of Science and Technology, India in 2009. I worked as a Lecturer at the College of Engineering Kidangoor during 2010-2011 and later joined Gemtech Solutions Pvt Ltd as Systems Engineer in 2011 before commencing my Master’s degree in 2013. I obtained my Master’s degree in Embedded System Design from the National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra, India. After completing my Master’s, I joined IBM as Business Intelligence Application Developer in 2015. Later, I moved into academic research at Nanyang Technological University Singapore as Research Associate (Deep Learning and Embedded Systems) in 2018 prior to joining KU Leuven in 2019.
</p>
<p style="font-size:100%;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">
My research interests and publications lie in the fields of FPGA-based system design, Network security, Probabilistic data structures, Approximate computing, and Convolutional Neural Networks on resource-constrained devices.
