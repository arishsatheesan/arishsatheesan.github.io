<p style="font-size:100%;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">
  I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at RWTH Aachen University, Germany. My research focuses on AI-aided beam management targeting edge platforms on reconfigurable hardware for 6G networks, bridging the gap between machine learning and real-world deployment for next-generation wireless communication systems.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from KU Leuven, Belgium, at the COSIC (ES&S Subgroup) under the supervision of Prof. Nele Mentens. My doctoral research specialized in FPGA Design for Network Security, specifically the acceleration of Large Flow Detection algorithms using configurable hardware (FPGA). This work was conducted in collaboration with the Network Security Group at ETH Zurich as part of the joint research project ESCALATE.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Cochin University of Science and Technology, India. Following graduation, I worked as a Lecturer at the College of Engineering Kidangoor before transitioning to industry as a Systems Engineer at Gemtech Solutions Pvt Ltd. Later, I obtained my Master’s degree in Embedded System Design at the National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra, India. Afterward, I joined IBM as a Business Intelligence Application Developer. In 2018, I moved into academic research as a Research Associate at the Hardware and Embedded Systems Lab, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, before commencing my Ph.D. at KU Leuven in 2019.
