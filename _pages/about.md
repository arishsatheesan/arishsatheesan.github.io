<p style="font-size:100%;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">
  Arish Satheesan is an Assistant Professor in Cybersecurity at Aalborg University, Denmark. His research lies at the intersection of reconfigurable systems, embedded intelligence, and secure hardware, with a strong focus on building trustworthy and high-performance solutions for next-generation edge and networked systems.
</p>
<p style="font-size:100%;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">
His research aims to build trustworthy and energy-efficient hardware platforms that enable real-time AI inference and security network solutions directly at the network edge. By co-designing algorithms and reconfigurable architectures, he addresses challenges in scalability, latency, and privacy across edge computing, cyber-physical systems, and next-generation communication networks. His work spans high-speed networking, millimeter-wave systems, and resource-constrained embedded devices, with validation on state-of-the-art FPGA platforms.
</p>
<p style="font-size:100%;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">
Prior to joining Aalborg University, Dr. Satheesan held research positions at RWTH Aachen University, KU Leuven, and Nanyang Technological University, where he worked on hardware-accelerated security mechanisms, embedded AI acceleration, and high-throughput network monitoring. His research has been published in premier journals and conferences spanning hardware design, cybersecurity, and networking, and has contributed to several nationally and internationally funded research projects.
</p>
<p style="font-size:100%;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">
Arish actively collaborates with academic and industry partners, driving interdisciplinary research that bridges fundamental hardware innovation with real-world deployments. Outside of research, he is passionate about mentoring students and building inclusive communities in engineering and computing.
