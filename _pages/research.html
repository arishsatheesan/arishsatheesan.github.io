<h2> Ongoing Research:</h2>
<h3>FPGA design for Network Security</h3>
This work concentrates on the acceleration of large flow detection algorithms using configurable hardware. An algorithm-architecture co-design approach will be followed to develop novel algorithms and implementations for data flows that only exceed the allowed bandwidth to a limited extent. The goal is to integrate the configurable hardware in network devices and demonstrate efficient and effective protection against large flow network attacks.

<h2>Past Research: </h2>
<h3>Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms on Resource Constrained devices</h3>
The main aim of this project was to Optimize deep learning algorithms, especially vision-based neural networks, both on algorithmic and hardware level and develop an automated tool for hardware-efficient implementation on FPGAs using Python and Verilog.
